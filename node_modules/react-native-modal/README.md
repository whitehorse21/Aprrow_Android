## Frequently Asked Questions

### The component is not working as expected
Under the hood `react-native-modal` uses react-native original [Modal component](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/modal.html).  
Before reporting a bug, try swapping `react-native-modal` with react-native original Modal component and, if the issue persists, check if it has already been reported as a [react-native issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues).  

## Avaliable animations

Take a look at [react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable) to see the dozens of animations available out-of-the-box. You can also pass in custom animation definitions and have them automatically register with react-native-animatable. For more information on creating custom animations, see the react-native-animatable [animation definition schema](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable#animation-definition-schema).
